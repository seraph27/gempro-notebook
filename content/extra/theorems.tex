\textbf{Erdos-Szekeres Theorem:} Every sequence of $(r - 1)(s - 1) + 1$ distinct integers has an increasing subsequence of size $r$ or a decreasing subsequence of size $s$.

\textbf{Burnside's Lemma:} Number of orbits = $\frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} |\text{Fix}(g)|$ where $G$ is group of symmetries, $\text{Fix}(g)$ is set of elements fixed by $g$

\textbf{Expected value is linear:} $\mathbb{E}(aX + bY) = a\mathbb{E}(X) + b\mathbb{E}(Y)$
